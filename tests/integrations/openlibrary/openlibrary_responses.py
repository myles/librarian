        "Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, and"

        " which he became a flying ace and intelligence agent. He rose to"
        " prominence in the 1940s with works for both children and adults, and"
        " became one of the world's bestselling authors. His short stories are"
        " known for their unexpected endings, and his children's books for"
        " their unsentimental, often very dark humour."

        " food, Mr. Fox and his family begin to starve. Mr. Fox devises a plan"
        " to steal food from the farmers by tunneling into the ground and"
        " borrowing into the farmer's houses.\n\nAided by a friendly Badger,"
        " the animals bring the stolen food back and Mrs. Fox prepares a great"
        " celebratory banquet attended by the other starving animals and their"
        " families. Mr. Fox invites all the animals to live with him"
        " underground and says that he will provide food for them daily thanks"
        " to his underground passages. All the animals live happily and"
        " safely, while the farmers remain waiting outside in vain for Mr. Fox"
        " to show up."
